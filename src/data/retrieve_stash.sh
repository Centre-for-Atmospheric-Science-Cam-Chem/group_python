# This a script to download pp files from the MASS archive that match a given stash number 
# and save to a specified directory. It is designed to be run on mass-cli or from account=mass
# when submitted from slurm
# It uses the moo select to filter out relevant stash. 
# As default, it will try 3 times before exiting.

# This script could be run directly from the command line, or
# as a batch download job from batch_retrieve_pp.sh, or
# as part of a larger workflow from batch_retrieve_and_convert_to_nc.sh

# Edit query_options.txt as appropriate for the data file being downloaded e.g. include year range
# See https://gws-access.jasmin.ac.uk/public/mohc_shared/moose-user-doc/external_user_guide.html#record-level-retrieval-query-syntax
# Example queries
#   T1=20180101
#   T2=20181231
# Do not set if downloading full time range

# Edit the try loop (imax) to change the number of attempts if needed.

# Usage: sh retrieve_pp.sh $jobID $stream $stash $download_dir $imax (optional) $queries

jobID=$1 # e.g. u-cu594
stream=$2 # e.g. ap4.pp
stash=$3 # e.g. 38285
download_dir=$4 # e.g. /work/scratch-pw2/vs480/pp_files/$jobID/${jobID}_${stream}_${stash}
imax=${5:-"3"} # default = 3
queries=${6:-""} # default is empty

# Get absolute path of queries if defined
