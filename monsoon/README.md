This directory is for code for use on Monsoon.
It contains the following scripts:



cleanup\_runs.sh:

Linux BASh script to delete cylc run data for all previous runs except the last 2, from all suites. An alternative to the 'cylc clean' command which leaves data from the most recent 2 runs intact. Does not reset the counter.



cylc\_gui.sh:

Linux BASh script for viewing the web user interface which shows running suites' progress on Monsoon3.
