# CAS shared scripts for working with UKESM1 data

This is an effort to document and share scripts with group members. Please make suggestions on how to make this space better and please feel free to fork and add your code and merge back!

This is not to enforce a way of work to anyone. Please feel free to do work your own way or take some parts of the code!

**For new members or people new to working with UKESM1 data**
- There is an example folder for common tasks. It may be a good idea to start there.

## How to use this repo?

The structure of this repo is somewhat based on [cookie-cutter datascience](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/) with a lot of tweaks to suit working on different HPCs.

The useage for each folder and the overall structure is explained below. This is not strict so just add stuff!:
- Example of tasks are listed in `examples/`. There will be a `README.md` in the folder to provide overview of the example tasks that scripts in this folder cover.
- All reusable functions live in `src/`
- Scripts that are somewhat stable and do specific tasks lives in `script/`. 
    - Scripts in this folder should be self-contained and are likely to call fuctions in `src/` but may just use common libraries such as `iris` or `xarray` to do some tasks.
- Shell scripts that automate scripts or series of tasks lives in `bin/`. 
    - I find that this is the best way to set variables for scripts to be recallable and task-specific.
- Interactive data exploration, especially python notebooks should be in `notebooks/`.
- Machine-specific and project-specific definitions should be in `config/`
- `data/` folder will not be version-controlled and may be used to hold some data.

## Plans
- Alex has shared his [R code base for evaluating UKESM1](https://github.com/Centre-for-Atmospheric-Science-Cam-Chem/ukesm1-eval-R). It would be extremely helpful to see if we could reuse the codes for evaluating UKESM1.3 and UKESM2 down the line.

## Other useful resources

- A lot more useful and group-specific information in the group wiki.
- UKCA training


## Change log

High-leve log. Earliest first.

- 2025-06-10:  Moved all existing scripts to `archive/`. Will slowly look at what is in there.
