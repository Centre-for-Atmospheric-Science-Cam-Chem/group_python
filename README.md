# CAS shared scripts

This is an effort to document and share scripts with group members. Please suggest improving this space, and please feel free to fork, add your code, and merge back. This is not to enforce a way of working on anyone. 

Please feel free to work your way or take some parts of the code!

See the [ukca-eval-python repo](https://github.com/Centre-for-Atmospheric-Science-Cam-Chem/ukesm-eval-python/) for code for evaluating UKESM data against observations. It is also shared and open to contributions.


**New to this repo?**
- There is an example folder for everyday tasks. It may be a good idea to start there.

## How to use this repo?

The structure of this repo is somewhat based on [cookie-cutter datascience](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/), with many tweaks to suit working on different HPCs.

The usage for each folder and the overall structure is explained below. This is not strict, so just add stuff!:
- Examples of tasks are listed in `examples/`. The folder will contain a `README.md` to provide an overview of the example tasks that the scripts in this folder cover.
- Reusable and stable functions live in `src/`.
- Scripts for specific tasks live in `script/`. 
    Scripts in this folder should be self-contained and likely to call functions in `src/`, but they may use shared libraries such as `iris` or `xarray` to perform some tasks.
    - It is good practice to set variables so that scripts are recallable, traceable and task-specific.
- Interactive data exploration should be in `notebooks/`, especially Python notebooks.
- Machine-specific and project-specific definitions should be in `config/`
- Get experimental, add your own work in `informal/` to develop, and move codes to the shared spaces when ready.
- The `data/` folder will not be version-controlled and may be used to store some data.

## Change log

High-level log. Earliest first.

- 2025-06-10:  Moved all existing scripts to `archive/`. Will slowly look at what is in there.
